<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="./assets/site-preview.png" >

Shortify is a web application that simplifies link management by offering two key functionalities:
- URL Shortening: Paste any lengthy URL into Shortify, and it will be transformed into a concise, user-friendly version. This not only improves readability but also makes sharing links through various platforms more convenient.
- QR Code Generation: Each shortened URL automatically generates a corresponding QR code. This allows users to share links seamlessly through printed materials, presentations, or even physical objects. Simply scan the QR code with a mobile device camera, and you'll be instantly directed to the original link.
